# Cronk: a cron-json translator

<!--
The standard commands for the Scorecard and Best Practices badges are:

    [![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/nebraska-dev/cronk/badge)](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/nebraska-dev/cronk)
    [![OpenSSF Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/6829/badge)](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/6829)

However, the badges and links always show the project's current scores. In order to
display the correct scores at each blog post, we've therefore used files stored in the
docs/ folder.
