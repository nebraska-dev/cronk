# Cronk: a cron-json translator

<!--
The standard command for the Scorecard badge is:

    [![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/{owner}/{repo}/badge)](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/{owner}/{repo})

However, the badge always shows the project's current score. The same goes for the link.
In order to display the correct score at each blog post, we've therefore used files
stored in the docs/ folder.
